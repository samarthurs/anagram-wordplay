# Anagram #

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram.

## Examples ##
* William Shakespeare = I am a weakish speller
* Helmuth Elsner = me run the shell
* Computer = mute proc = CPU metro
* Visual Studio = loud USA visit = itâ€™s usual void
* Wareneingang = gain new range = earn gang wine = eager wanning = aging earn new

## Task ##

Given a file containing one word per line and a search phrase, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams of the search phrase.

* Letter  case does not matter. 
* Special characters should be ignored. 
* Ignore short dictionary words (those having only one or two letters).
